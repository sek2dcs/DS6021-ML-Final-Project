# DS6021-ML-Final-Project

## NEEDS: 
- 6-8 slide presentation
- original dataset in csv or excel format
      - raw & clean versions
- compiled code
- published app


**who is the most “attractive” in the cohort?**

Notes from meeting with Sheng (10/06): 
- https://github.com/Aksoylu/GoldenFace
- training model on random face data then test data is the cohort pics? 
- open cv = another good library
    - image processing functions have been embedded in here
    - good processing times
    - most efficient 

- landmarks = locations of nose, corner of nose/corner of mouth
    - open cv = has existing functions 
    - facial attractiveness classification

- look at paper from sheng
- could do something like make face more attractiveness (extra credit) 
- racial bias?
      - eastern vs western (because there is bias in golden ratio for western faces)
      - a sub-question
- feminine vs masculine vs androgynous
    - what is considered the most objectively attractive?

## timeline 

oct 6: indivudally research the documentation for open cv & also the papers that sheng sent

oct 13: pull numeric data for multilinear regression 

oct 20: have multilinear regression built out by end of week

oct 27: logit model (figure out what that means)

nov 11: have KNN model built out by end of week

nov 16: have K means model built out by end of week 

dec 1: have MLP model built out by end of week 


continually build out shiny/dash app throughout process 
PRESENTATION BY DEC

Next Steps: 

- collect head shots from cohort
- share code
- come up with columns/categories
