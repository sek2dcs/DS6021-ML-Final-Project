**who is the most “attractive” in the cohort?**

Notes from meeting with Sheng (10/06): 
- https://github.com/Aksoylu/GoldenFace
- training model on random face data then test data is the cohort pics? 
- open cv = another good library
    - image processing functions have been embedded in here
    - good processing times
    - most efficient 

- landmarks = locations of nose, corner of nose/corner of mouth
    - open cv = has existing functions 
    - facial attractiveness classification

- look at paper from sheng
- could do something like make face more attractiveness (extra credit) 
- racial bias?
      - eastern vs western (because there is bias in golden ratio for western faces)
      - a sub-question
- feminine vs masculine vs androgynous
    - what is considered the most objectively attractive?
